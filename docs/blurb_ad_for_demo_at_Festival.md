# Workshop PyTorch on Graphcore
... at the [Festival of Digital Research & Scholarship](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/events/2024/jun/festival-digital-research-scholarship)

[Graphcore](graphcore.ai) are an innovative UK company who make an accelerator systems for machine learning. [Project Contender](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/coming-soon-platforms) at UCL's Centre For Advanced Research Computing [(ARC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/) has a [Graphcore IPU-POD 16 Direct Attach](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-pod16-datasheet/en/latest/product-description.html#pod16-direct-attach) system. This is programmable using their own extensions to PyTorch called [PopTorch](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/intro.html). As an introduction to this and to these machines generally, attendees will convert a simple PyTorch machine learning code to PopTorch (generally following the instructions at [From PyTorch to PopTorch](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/pytorch_to_poptorch.html)) and run it on our Graphcore machine. 

As Moore's Law fails and an increasing variety of machine learing accelerators become available, students and pracitioners of machine learning will need to become familiar with these technologies to inform their decisions about which platforms to use. 

Registration is required due to limited places and to arrange access to the machine and test that beforehand. (Attendees will need to have a UCL ID already.)
